Africa, UAE, and Asia regions, with local payment methods including
M-Pesa, Paystack, and Flutterwave.

ReadIn AI supports 45 languages including English, French, Arabic, Swahili,
Hindi, Mandarin, and many more. The AI can provide talking points in the

Absolutely. ReadIn AI processes everything locally on your device. Your
audio and conversations are never recorded, stored, or sent to external
servers. Privacy is built into our core architecture.

Huddles, Discord, and 35+ other apps. If you can have a meeting on it,

in real-time - no typing, no waiting, no context-switching.
