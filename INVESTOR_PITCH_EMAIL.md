**Subject: ReadIn AI - The Invisible AI Meeting Assistant (Seed Round)**

---

Dear [Investor Name],

I'm reaching out to introduce **ReadIn AI**, a real-time AI assistant that helps professionals communicate confidently in meetings, interviews, and live presentations—without anyone knowing they're using it.

### The Problem

Every day, millions of professionals freeze during important calls. A client asks a tough question. An interviewer throws a curveball. A panel moderator challenges your expertise. The cost? Lost deals, missed opportunities, and damaged credibility.

### Our Solution

ReadIn AI listens to what others are saying and instantly generates 2-4 bullet-point talking points within 2 seconds—displayed in a discreet overlay. Users glance, rephrase in their own words, and respond with confidence.

**The key differentiator: Complete Stealth Mode.**

Unlike competitors that send bots into meetings (immediately visible to participants), ReadIn AI:
- Captures audio locally via our desktop app
- Processes speech-to-text on-device using Whisper
- Generates responses via Claude API
- Remains 100% invisible to other participants

This is critical for high-stakes environments—TV interviews, legal consultations, medical discussions, and executive negotiations where being "caught" using AI would destroy credibility.

### What We've Built

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Real-Time Responses** | 2-second generation of contextual talking points |
| **30+ Platform Support** | Zoom, Teams, Meet, Webex, and all major video apps |
| **9 Profession Profiles** | Tailored AI for engineers, salespeople, lawyers, doctors, executives |
| **Meeting Intelligence** | Auto-summaries, action items, commitment tracking |
| **Participant Memory** | Remembers what each person said across meetings |
| **Cross-Platform** | Windows, macOS, Linux + Browser Extensions |

### Business Model

| Tier | Price | Target |
|------|-------|--------|
| Premium | $29.99/mo | Individual professionals |
| Team | $19.99/user/mo | Small teams (5-10) |
| Growth | $14.99/user/mo | Mid-market (11-50) |
| Enterprise | Custom | Large organizations (50+) |

### Market Opportunity

- **1B+ professionals** participate in video calls daily
- **$50B+ market** for meeting productivity tools
- High-value verticals: Legal, Healthcare, Finance, Sales, Media
- Growing demand for AI-assisted communication post-pandemic

### Current Stage

We're pre-revenue with a fully functional product deployed at **www.getreadin.us**. Our technology is production-ready with:
- Complete desktop applications (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Browser extensions (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
- Enterprise-ready backend with Stripe billing integration
- GDPR-compliant privacy architecture

### The Ask

We're raising a **$[X] seed round** to:
1. Launch go-to-market with targeted acquisition in 3 key verticals
2. Build sales team for enterprise pipeline
3. Expand AI capabilities (more professions, languages)
4. Scale infrastructure for growth

### Why Now?

AI-assisted communication is inevitable. The question is: **visible or invisible?**

Professionals don't want to appear reliant on AI—they want to appear naturally brilliant. ReadIn AI makes that possible.

I'd love 20 minutes to demo the product and discuss how we're positioning for this market. Are you available this week?

Best regards,

**[Your Name]**

*P.S. - Try it yourself: The stealth experience is the "aha moment." I can set up a live demo where you interview me on any topic—you won't be able to tell I'm using it.*
