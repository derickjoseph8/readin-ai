# TIER 1: ACCELERATOR APPLICATIONS

## Y Combinator (Spring 2026)

**Apply at:** https://www.ycombinator.com/apply

### Application Answers

**Describe what your company does in 50 characters or less:**
AI meeting assistant that's invisible to others

**What is your company going to make?**
ReadIn AI is a real-time AI assistant that listens to video calls and generates instant talking points—completely invisible to other participants. Unlike competitors that send visible bots into meetings, our desktop app captures audio locally, processes speech-to-text on-device using Whisper, and generates contextual responses via Claude API in under 2 seconds.

**Why did you pick this idea to work on?**
We noticed professionals freezing in high-stakes conversations—interviews, sales calls, legal consultations—where being "caught" using AI would destroy credibility. Every existing tool (Otter, Fireflies, Fathom) sends a visible bot. We built the solution we wished existed: AI assistance that's completely invisible.

**What's new about what you're making?**
100% stealth operation. No meeting bots, no notifications to participants, no detection possible. Audio captured locally via system audio routing. This unlocks use cases competitors can't touch: TV interviews, medical consultations, executive negotiations, legal depositions.

**What do you understand about your users that others don't?**
Professionals don't want to appear reliant on AI—they want to appear naturally brilliant. The stigma of "needing help" is real in high-stakes environments. Our users aren't looking for meeting notes; they're looking for real-time confidence without anyone knowing.

**How do or will you make money?**
SaaS subscription: Premium ($29.99/mo individual), Team ($19.99/user/mo), Enterprise (custom). High-value verticals (legal, medical, executive) will pay premium for stealth capability.

**How far along are you?**
Fully built and deployed at www.getreadin.us. Desktop apps for Windows, macOS, Linux. Browser extensions for Chrome, Edge, Firefox. Enterprise backend with Stripe billing, GDPR compliance, 9 profession-specific AI profiles.

**How long have each of you been working on this?**
[Your timeline]

**Why did you choose this idea?**
Personal experience with interview anxiety and seeing colleagues struggle in high-stakes calls. Realized that AI meeting tools solve the wrong problem—people don't just want transcripts, they want real-time confidence.

**What's the #1 thing your company needs to grow faster?**
Distribution. We have the product—we need to reach the professionals who need it most. YC's network would accelerate access to enterprise buyers and strategic partnerships.

**Who are your competitors?**
Otter.ai, Fireflies.ai, Fathom, Grain. All use visible meeting bots. We're the only stealth solution—different category entirely.

**What's your burn rate?**
[Your current burn]

## Techstars

**Subject: Techstars Application - ReadIn AI: Invisible AI Meeting Assistant**

Dear Techstars Team,

ReadIn AI is applying to Techstars because we believe AI-assisted communication will transform how professionals work—and we're building the version that actually fits real-world needs.

**The Problem:** Existing AI meeting tools send visible bots that other participants can see. This makes them unusable in high-stakes environments where appearing to "need help" damages credibility.

**Our Solution:** A desktop application that captures audio locally, transcribes on-device, and generates real-time talking points—completely invisible to other participants.

**Why Techstars:** Your focus on B2B automation aligns perfectly with our enterprise roadmap. We're seeking mentorship on go-to-market strategy for high-value verticals (legal, medical, executive communications).

**Traction:** Fully built product deployed at www.getreadin.us. Desktop apps for all platforms. Ready for user acquisition.

## Antler

**Subject: Antler Application - ReadIn AI (AI-Native Meeting Assistant)**

Dear Antler Team,

I'm applying to Antler with ReadIn AI—the first AI meeting assistant designed for stealth operation.

**What we've built:**
- Real-time AI that generates talking points in 2 seconds
- 100% invisible to other meeting participants
- Desktop apps for Windows, macOS, Linux
- 30+ video platform support (Zoom, Teams, Meet, Webex)
- 9 profession-specific AI profiles

**Why we're different:**
Every competitor (Otter, Fireflies, Fathom) sends visible bots into meetings. Professionals in high-stakes environments—lawyers, doctors, executives, media professionals—can't use visible AI assistance. We're the only solution for these use cases.

**Why Antler:**
Your 6-month program structure fits our go-to-market timeline. We have the product; we need strategic guidance on enterprise sales and vertical expansion.

Looking forward to discussing how ReadIn AI fits Antler's thesis.

Best,

## Boost VC

**Subject: Boost VC - ReadIn AI: Deep Tech for Invisible AI Assistance**

Dear Boost VC Team,

ReadIn AI represents a new category in AI meeting technology: invisible assistance.

**Technical Architecture:**
- On-device speech-to-text using OpenAI Whisper
- Real-time audio capture via system audio routing (no meeting API integration needed)
- Claude API for contextual response generation
- Sub-2-second end-to-end latency

**Why this matters:**
Invisible operation unlocks $50B+ in high-stakes communication markets that visible AI tools can't address: legal consultations, medical discussions, executive negotiations, media appearances.

**Current state:**
Production-ready at www.getreadin.us. Cross-platform desktop apps. Enterprise-ready backend.

Boost VC's deep tech focus aligns with our architecture-first approach. Would love to discuss.

## 2048 Ventures
**Focus:** Vertical AI, Deep Tech, AI/ML
**Check Size:** $500K–$2M

**Subject: ReadIn AI - Vertical AI for High-Stakes Communication**

Dear 2048 Ventures Team,

I'm reaching out about ReadIn AI, a vertical AI solution for real-time meeting assistance—built specifically for professionals in high-stakes communication environments.

**Why we fit your thesis:**

1. **Vertical AI:** We're not a horizontal meeting tool. We're building AI specifically for high-stakes verticals: legal (depositions, client calls), medical (patient consultations), executive (board meetings, negotiations), and media (live interviews).

2. **Deep Tech Foundation:** Our architecture is fundamentally different—on-device Whisper for transcription, local audio capture (no meeting APIs), and optimized LLM inference for sub-2-second responses.

3. **Defensible Moat:** The stealth capability creates a moat. Competitors would need to rebuild their entire architecture to match our invisible operation.

**Current State:**
- Production app at www.getreadin.us
- Cross-platform desktop + browser extensions
- 9 profession-specific AI profiles
- Enterprise-ready with Stripe billing

**The Ask:**
We're raising a seed round to launch go-to-market in legal and executive communication verticals. 2048's expertise in vertical AI would accelerate our penetration of these high-value markets.

Would you have 20 minutes this week for a demo?

## 1984 Ventures
**Focus:** AI problem-solving
**Check Size:** $500K–$1M

**Subject: ReadIn AI - Solving the "Caught Using AI" Problem**

Dear 1984 Ventures Team,

ReadIn AI solves a problem most AI companies ignore: **the stigma of using AI in public.**

**The Problem:**
Professionals freeze in high-stakes conversations. AI could help—but existing tools are visible. Using Otter or Fireflies in a job interview, client meeting, or TV appearance would be worse than the original problem.

**Our Solution:**
An AI assistant that's completely invisible. Captures audio locally, generates responses in 2 seconds, displays in a discreet overlay. No one knows you're using it.

**Why this matters:**
The $50B meeting tools market has an invisible segment: professionals who need help but can't be seen getting it. We're the only solution for lawyers, doctors, executives, and media professionals in high-stakes situations.

**Traction:**
Fully deployed at www.getreadin.us. Desktop apps. Enterprise backend. Ready for go-to-market.

Your focus on AI problem-solving resonates with our approach. Would love to discuss.

**Subject: ReadIn AI - The Future of Workplace Communication**

Dear Bloomberg Beta Team,

Bloomberg Beta's focus on the future of work aligns perfectly with ReadIn AI—an invisible AI assistant that transforms how professionals communicate in meetings.

**Why This Is The Future of Work:**

1. **AI-Assisted Communication:** We're not replacing human communication—we're augmenting it. Real-time talking points help professionals think faster, not think less.

2. **Invisible Integration:** The best workplace tools are invisible. ReadIn AI works with existing workflows (Zoom, Teams, Meet) without changing behavior.

3. **Knowledge Work Evolution:** As meetings proliferate, knowledge workers need tools that help them perform, not just record. Real-time assistance is the next evolution.

**What We've Built:**
- 2-second response generation
- 30+ video platform support
- 9 profession profiles (engineer, sales, legal, medical, etc.)
- Meeting intelligence (summaries, action items)
- Cross-platform: Windows, macOS, Linux, browser extensions

**The Difference:**
Every other meeting tool sends visible bots. We're invisible—unlocking use cases in high-stakes environments where being "caught" would damage credibility.

Dear Notation Capital Team,

Notation's product-obsessed approach resonates with how we built ReadIn AI—starting with user experience, not technology.

2. **One-Click Simplicity:** No setup, no integrations, no meeting links. Open the app, join any call, get instant assistance.

3. **Context-Aware Intelligence:** We don't just transcribe—we understand. Talking points adapt to conversation context, user profession, and speaking style.

**Check Size:** $500K–$2.5M

**Subject: ReadIn AI - AI Meeting Assistant for the Invisible AI Era**

Dear Outlander VC Team,

We're building ReadIn AI for a future where AI assistance is ubiquitous but invisible—starting with the meeting room.

**Why Now:**
- AI capabilities have reached real-time feasibility
- Remote work normalized video calls as primary communication
- Professionals are comfortable with AI assistance—but not visible assistance

**Subject: ReadIn AI - SaaS Meeting Assistant Seeking Product-Market Fit Capital**

Dear Craft Ventures Team,

ReadIn AI is seeking seed investment to validate product-market fit for our invisible AI meeting assistant.

**What We've Built:**
The first AI meeting assistant that's completely invisible to other participants. Real-time talking points in 2 seconds. Works with Zoom, Teams, Meet, Webex, and 30+ platforms.

**Why Stealth Matters:**
High-stakes professionals—lawyers, doctors, executives, media professionals—can't use visible AI assistance. We're the only solution for these use cases.

**PMF Strategy:**
1. Launch in 3 high-value verticals (legal, executive, sales)
2. Validate pricing and feature priorities
3. Build case studies and testimonials
4. Expand horizontally with validated playbook

**Current State:**
Production at www.getreadin.us. Product is built. Need capital to find PMF.

**The Ask:**
$[X] to reach PMF with clear metrics: paying customers, retention, and expansion in target verticals.

Would appreciate discussing the PMF journey.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

## General Catalyst
**Focus:** Applied AI, B2B
**Check Size:** $1M–$10M

**Subject: ReadIn AI - Applied AI for Enterprise Communication**

Dear General Catalyst Team,

ReadIn AI applies AI to enterprise communication—helping professionals communicate with confidence using invisible real-time assistance.

**Applied AI Approach:**
We didn't build AI looking for a problem. We started with a clear user need—high-stakes communication anxiety—and built the AI architecture required to solve it.

**B2B Focus:**
- Team licenses for sales, customer success, executive teams
- Enterprise deployment with SSO, admin controls, compliance
- High-value verticals: legal, medical, finance, executive

**Why Now:**
AI capabilities have reached real-time feasibility. Remote work normalized video calls. Professionals accept AI assistance—but not visible assistance.

**Current State:**
Production at www.getreadin.us. Ready for enterprise go-to-market.

**The Ask:**
Seed capital to build enterprise pipeline in 3 target verticals.

Would welcome discussing the opportunity.

## Index Ventures
**Focus:** AI-native startups
**Check Size:** $1M–$10M

**Subject: ReadIn AI - AI-Native Meeting Assistant (Seed Round)**

Dear Index Ventures Team,

ReadIn AI is AI-native from day one—an invisible meeting assistant where AI is the entire product, not a feature.

**AI-Native Architecture:**
- **Transcription:** On-device Whisper (privacy-first)
- **Understanding:** Real-time context tracking across speakers
- **Generation:** Claude API with optimized prompts
- **Learning:** User preference adaptation over time

**Why AI-Native Matters:**
We're not bolting AI onto existing meeting software. We're building the meeting experience around AI capabilities—specifically, the capability to assist invisibly in real-time.

**The Differentiator:**
100% invisible operation. This isn't a feature—it's the foundation. Every architectural decision serves stealth operation.

**Current State:**
Production at www.getreadin.us. AI-native from core architecture to user experience.

Would love to discuss how we fit Index's AI-native thesis.
